My name is Paul Gaddy and I'm a high school senior at Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx, New York. I've been interested in computers since 7th grade when we did basic web development. Since then, I've greatly improved my CS skills in a wide array of areas from processing to basic web development to game development to Android development to Java(basic) to Python(basic) to Firebase to AI as well as a few others. Here are some my best projects

1.I've been working on a project at Google Launch for about 2-3 months. The project is basically Linkedin for the Google Code Next program. In it, you can view everyone's profile, edit your profile, send messages to others, book time to meet with the coaches, post on a forum, view the schedules of the coaches along with a few other features. Along with all of this, I included the pitch deck.(Node js, Firebase)

2.This is the facial recognition project that I worked on in the 11th grade. You begin by uploading a picture of a person/people. The app uses the catalog of labeled images and labels each person in the photo. (Javascript)

3.I created the Platformer game in 9th grade and it is my second favorite game. The game has different platforms for the character to walk on. The characters can setup different animations for different positions (walking, running, jumping, etc). You can also pick-up items and earn extra points. The game ends when you fall off of a ledge. (Javascript, p5.js)

4.I created the museum app in 10th grade. The premise of the game is to click through different exhibits and view different photos from each exhibit. Each exhibit has descriptions, and the libraries are interchangeable, .(Java, Android Studio)

5.This is the card matching game I created in 9th grade. The premise of the game is to match cards. During each potential match, different sound plays. If you mismatch the cards twice in a row, the game ends  (Javascript, p5.js)
