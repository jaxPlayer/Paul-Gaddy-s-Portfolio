My name is Paul Gaddy and I'm a high school senior at Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx, New York. I've been interested in computers since 7th grade when we did basic web development. Since then, I've greatly improved my CS skills in a wide array of areas from processing to basic web development to game development to Android development to Java(basic) to Python(basic) to Firebase to AI as well as a few others. Here are my best projects

* This is the shooter game I made in 9th grade. You use the spacebar to navigate and each time you land a hit on the alien, you gain a point. If you miss too many times, you lose a turn and the game ends. (Javascript, p5.js)

* This is the card matching game I made in 9th grade. The premise of the game is to match cards. If you mess up twice, the game ends. During each turn, a different sound plays if you match the cards, miss one or the game ends. (Javascript, p5.js)


* This is the platformer game I did in 9th grade. I created different platforms for the characters to walk on, setup different animations for different positions (walking, running, jumping etc). Along with this, you can pick up items and earn extra points. The game ends when you fall off of a ledge. (Javascript, p5.js)


* This is the museum app I created in 10th grade. This project used a few different libraries and the premise of it is to click through different exhibits and see different photos from each exhibits along with descriptions of each item.(Java, Android Studio)

* This is the facial recognition project I worked on in 11th grade. You upload a picture of a person/people and it uses the catalog of labeled images and it labels each person in the photo. (Javascript)

* Lastly, I've been working on something at Google Launch for about 2-3 months. The project is basically Linkedin for the Google Code Next program. In it, you can view everyone's profile, edit your profile, send messages to others, book time to meet with the coaches, post on a forum, view the schedules of the coaches along with a few other features. Along with all of this, I included the pitch deck.(Node js, Firebase)
